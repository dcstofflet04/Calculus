# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Before we look at line integrals, we must first understand the fundamental theorem of calculus, as these are very similar concepts.

$$\int_a^b F'(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

This is a concept we learned in Calculus 2. Moving on to Calculus 3 concepts, we recently learnd line integrals. If C is a smooth curve given by a vector function r(t), a < t < b. If f is a differential function of two or three variables whose gradient vector $$\nabla$$f is continuous on C. Given thse conditions, the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is

$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot dr - f(r(b)) - f(r(a))$$
