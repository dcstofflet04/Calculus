# 16.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Before we look at line integrals, we must first understand the fundamental theorem of calculus, as these are very similar concepts.

$$\int_a^b F'(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

## Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals

This is a concept we learned in Calculus 2. Moving on to Calculus 3 concepts, we recently learnd line integrals. If C is a smooth curve given by a vector function r(t), a < t < b. If f is a differential function of two or three variables whose gradient vector is continuous on C. Given thse conditions, the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is

$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot dr - f(r(b)) - f(r(a))$$

This can also be written as 

$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot dr - f(x_1,y_2) - f(x_1, y_1)$$

With 3 variables, the formula can be written as 

$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot dr - f(x_1,y_2, z_2) - f(x_1, y_1, z_1)$$

## Gradient Vector 

Just as review, to find the gradient vector, one must take function f(x), and find the partial derivatives.


$$\nabla f = \lt f_x, f_y \gt$$

$$\nabla f = \lt f_x, f_y, f_z \gt $$

## Conservative Vector Field

If

$$\partial f \frac{\partial x}$$
